# Predicting Sale Price of Houses
> The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses.
> Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or under-estimated.
>We aim to minimise the difference between the real price and the price estimated by our model. We will evaluate model performance with the:
-mean squared error (mse)
-root squared of the mean squared error (rmse)
-r-squared (r2).
